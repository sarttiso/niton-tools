# Niton Tools

This package provides a set of python tools for interacting with data generated by the Thermo Fisher Niton XL5 Plus handheld XRF device. The code is catered to XRF usage in the Macdonald lab in EAPS at UC Berkeley, but could be used or adapted by anybody working with similar handheld XRF devices.

The package provides the following functionality:
- User interface for adding standard measurements to a single SQLite database managed by [`GeochemDB`](https://github.com/sarttiso/geochemdb).
    - Assumes that standard measurements are systematically aggregated within an excel file where each sheet contains standard measurements from a single analytical session
    - Assumes a preconfigured SQLite database with filled auxililary tables and compatibility with [`GeochemDB`](https://github.com/sarttiso/geochemdb)
- Instrument calibration based on standard measurements (in progress)
    - Ability to correct concentrations for unknowns according to element-specific calibration lines constrained by known standard measurements
    - Assumes standard measurements are stored in `GeochemDB`-compatible SQLite database
    - Assumes standard compositions are defined

## Installation

```bash
pip install niton-tools
```
